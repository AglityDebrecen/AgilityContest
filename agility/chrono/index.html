<!-- 
This is a simple web page to ask server to retrieve 
assigned session id and store into a file

The idea is to use an embedded system to get tracking of photocells events,
store timestamp and send events to server based on received information

The event to be sent is so simple:
{ 
	ID: SessionID,
	Source: SourceID
	Type: 'chrono',
	Time: <timestamp> (milliseconds)
}
